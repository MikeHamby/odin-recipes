        <li><strong>Step 2</strong><span></span>  Cut pork roast in half lengthwise. Cut each half again lengthwise forming 4 long, thick pieces of pork.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 3 </strong><span></span>  Transfer cooled sauce to a large mixing bowl. Stir in red food coloring. Place pork sections into sauce and coat each piece. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 to 12 hours.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 4 </strong><span></span>  eheat grill for medium heat, 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 6 </strong><span></span>  Transfer pork sections to grate over indirect heat on the prepared grill. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes. Brush with marinade; turn. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes more. Do not use any more marinade on cooked meat until after you boil it.</li>

    <h3>Chef Mike's Special Note:</h3>
    <p>If you happen to be using your standard, backyard kettle-shaped grill, push all your coals to one side, and place your meat on the other. To add an extra layer of protection, you can also put it in a roasting pan, and place that on the grill. Or, forget the great outdoors, and simply roast it in the oven. The only catch is, you'll need to place it under the broiler at the end, to simulate the caramelization we get on the barbeque.</p>
